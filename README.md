# CS230-Design-Doc
The Gaming Room is a client that hosts a web-based game. They are looking to expand their game to mobile and other platforms, and want their infrastructure to meet requirements for the increase in demand. I did well articulating the differences in platforms and the reccomendations for how best to build the app. Understanding the goal of the application sheds light on the importance of the code's integrity and the procedures put in place for security and distaster plans, writing the design doc allowed me to see the big picture, and how the pieces of development fit together to build a service for users. If I had to redo work, I would add more detail to the domain and requirements section. Both are a little lackluster and do not accurately describe the needs of the client. I interpreted the user's needs through myself, asking what I would need and appreciate as a user. I also researched security protocols, operating systems, and various languages to check features against the needs of the client to ensure I provided the options that best fit this use-case. I approached software design by asking what would work best for the context of the project, and then checking the tools, languages, and architecture at my disposal to ensure success.
